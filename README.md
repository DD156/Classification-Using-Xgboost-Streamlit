    ```

## Usage

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Perform initial data exploration to understand data distributions, correlations, and outliers.
- Generate visualizations to summarize insights from the data.

### Statistical Analysis and Visualization

- Conduct statistical tests and create visualizations to gain deeper insights into the data.

### Data Encoding

- Encode categorical variables to prepare the data for machine learning models.

### XGBoost and Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna

- Implement XGBoost for predictive modeling.
- Use Optuna for hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

### Pipeline Creation

- Develop reusable data processing and model training pipelines for efficient workflow management.

### Streamlit Interface

- Access the Streamlit web app with admin and student pages, login features, and various customizations.
- Perform what-if and sensitivity analyses.
- Integrate Power BI for enhanced data visualization and reporting. *(Make sure you give your own report URL if you want to replicate)*

To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run bullying_gui.py
